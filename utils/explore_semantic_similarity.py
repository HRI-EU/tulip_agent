"""
Utility for exploring semantic similarity thresholds; which may depend on the application.

Note: OpenAI recommends cosine similarity, but embeddings are normalized, so the rankings
for cosine similarity and euclidian are identical
https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6824809-embeddings-frequently-asked-questions

Insight:
1.25 seems to be a reasonable cutoff for l2-squared
this still includes aggregate functions but not completely unrelated ones
